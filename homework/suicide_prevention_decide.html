          <dd>
            <p>
                  Your best friend, who has confided to you that he/she is under a doctorâ€™s care for extreme depression,
              has told you that he/she feels that life is not worth living. Today at lunch your friend told you that
              he/she had attempted suicide twice this past weekend. You are the only one who knows about the suicide attempts.
              Your friend made you promise that you would not tell anyone.
                  This can be a very problematic issue, you're told that you should tell the parents, but some parents won't
              take it well, they may put their child into an even more depressive state because they are scared, but don't
              want to show it, so they act angry. Other parents will start to baby their older child and further depress them
              by embarrassing them. It is important to keep in mind both the psychology of the friend and their parents. 
              Obviously, you don't want to let your friend down by breaking the trust, which also won't help the situation.
              In any case, the idea is to both prove to them that life can be worth living, while also keeping them alive to do so.
              Either way, you want to learn more about the issue to know how to remedy them, because if it is an abusive parent, 
              you wouldn't want to tell them, because they'd become more aggressive, if it has stress from school, you'd want to work 
              with their parents and the school to find ways around the work, for me, I had both problems, on top of bullying and a very
              damaging teacher. In this case, I'll keep it to a <b>very</b> abusive father, with a supressed mother, causing
              him to have school problems.

          <dd>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Work with the mother to gain sole custody of their son and a restraining order on the father. While working
                with your friend to give him hope, probably by having fun together after helping with homework.
              </li>
              <li>
                Work with the mother and teachers/school administration to temporarily take off some of the homework load to
                remedy the current situation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do nothing with the parents and just focus on having fun with your friend.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </dd>
        <dt><strong>C</strong>----Consider the Consequences. What are the pros and cons for each option?</dt>
          <dd>
            <i>Pros:</i>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Both your friend and his mum have a huge load of stress and anxiety taken off their backs and 
                  could probably have a much better relationship together.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He at least has some stress taken off his back, so maybe he'll have some more time to enjoy life.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bro time! School is made somewhat better and you get to do stuff together.
                </li>
              </ol>
            <i>Cons:</i>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The mother may be extremely afraid to do so, in fear of more abuse. And it can be difficult finding enough solid
                  evidence for the court to grant your wishes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unless your school administration isn't full of lazy, stubborn, crabs, then it takes a lot of poking-the-bear,
                  and by the time that happens it may be too late.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Doesn't fix much of the situation, and both sources of stress will still be present.
                </li>
              </ol>
          </dd>
        <dt><strong>I</strong>----Identify your values. What is most important to you, and how do these options fit your beliefs?</dt>
          <dd>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Independent thought: people shouldn't have to be made puppets slaves, or a lower class. With option one, this
                happens for two people
              </li>
              <li>
                Peace: like seriously, there's too much hatred from people being closed-minded 
              </li>
              <li>
                Funs: Life is pointless with fun, and hugs, ang hugs, I changed my dad majorly(for him, relatively speaking), 
                in two years, as opposed to my mom's ineffective 14 years, primarily with hugging and subtle psychology hints.
                All options support this.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </dd>

            <p>
              I'd try to go for all 3, it may be difficult to complete all, but I'd definitely place 1 above all, because then she
              could help with 2, and maybe even 3. But either way, there'd be a hint of 3 either way.
            </p>
          </dd>

              If he dies, at least help the mother and see what happens to the dad, it would make a very interesting psychology case to study
              his reaction. Whatever does happen, I'd like to know that I tried my hardest, and put all the effort I could into helping
              him. And learn how to better deal with the legal system and school administrations from that, for furure reference.
